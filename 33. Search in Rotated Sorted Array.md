## 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium)
- if the target is in the part that has order, search the part. Since only the in order part can be determined.
- else go to the other side. 

Formula: If a sorted array is shifted, if you take the middle, always one side will be sorted. Take the recursion according to that rule.
1- take the middle and compare with target, if matches return.   
2- if middle is bigger than left side, it means left is sorted.  
2a- if [left] <= target <= [middle] then do recursion with left, middle - 1 (right).  
2b- left side is sorted, but target not in here, search on right side middle + 1 (left), right.  
3- if middle is less than right side, it means right is sorted.  
3a- if [middle] <= target <= [right] then do recursion with middle + 1 (left), right.  
3b- right side is sorted, but target not in here, search on left side left, middle -1 (right).  

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while(left + 1< right):
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            # on left part
            if nums[mid] >= nums[left]:
                if nums[left] <= target <= nums[mid]:
                    right = mid
                else:
                    left = mid
            else:
                if nums[mid] <= target <= nums[right]:
                    left = mid
                else:
                    right = mid
        # return left if nums[left] == target else right if nums[right] == target else -1
        if nums[left] == target:
            return left
        elif nums[right] == target:
            return right
        else:
            return -1
```
