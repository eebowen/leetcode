## 253. Meeting Rooms II

### Algorithm
- similar to the meeting room question
- add (start time,1) and (end time, -1) to a list
- sort the list by first and second entry of each point.
- using a count, and loop through the whole point list, add 1 if started and reduce 1 if ended. keep track of the max count in the whole process and return the max. 

```python
class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        pointList = []
        maxRoom = 0
        count = 0
        for onePoint in intervals:
            pointList.append((onePoint[0], 1))
            pointList.append((onePoint[1], -1))
        pointList.sort(key=lambda x:(x[0], x[1]))
        print(pointList)
        for onePoint in pointList:
            count += onePoint[1]
            maxRoom = max(maxRoom, count)
        return maxRoom

```
