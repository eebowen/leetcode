## 200. Number of Islands (Medium)
### Python deque
[Collections Deque documents](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#deque-objects)
- from collections improt deque
- deque (Aversge O(1))is faster than using list (O(n) time)
- .append() .appendleft() .popleft() .popright()

### Algorithm 1 BFS
1. Use BFS and a queue to record connected nodes
2. Set grid to 0 after visted
- Time complexity: O(Width * Height)  = O(N)
- Space complexity: O(min(M,N)), because in worst case where the grid is filled with lands, the size of queue can grow up to min

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        directions = [[0,1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
        gridQ = deque()
        gridHeight = len(grid)
        gridWidth = len(grid[0])
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(gridHeight):
            for j in range(gridWidth):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    gridQ.append([i, j])
                    grid[i][j] = '0'
                    ans += 1
                while(gridQ):
                    curGrid = gridQ.popleft()
                    for oneDir in directions:
                        x = curGrid[0] + oneDir[0]
                        y = curGrid[1] + oneDir[1]
                        if x >= 0 and y >= 0 \
                        and x < gridHeight and y < gridWidth \
                        and grid[x][y] == '1':
                            gridQ.append([x, y])
                            grid[x][y] = '0'
        return ans
```

### Algorithm 2 DFS
- Time complexity: O(Width * Height)  = O(N)
- Space complexity: O(N) in case that the grid map is filled with lands where DFS goes by N deep.
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        gridHeight = len(grid)
        gridWidth = len(grid[0])
        ans = 0
        for i in range(gridHeight):
            for j in range(gridWidth):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    ans += 1
                    self.dfs(grid, [i, j])
        return ans
    
    def dfs(self, grid, oneGrid):
        directions = [[0,1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]
        if oneGrid[0] < 0 or oneGrid[1] < 0 \
        or oneGrid[0] >= len(grid) or oneGrid[1] >= len(grid[0]) \
        or grid[oneGrid[0]][oneGrid[1]] != '1':
            return;
        grid[oneGrid[0]][oneGrid[1]] = '0'
        for oneDir in directions:
            self.dfs(grid, [oneGrid[0]+ oneDir[0], oneGrid[1] + oneDir[1]])
```
