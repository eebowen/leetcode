## 207. Course Schedule


- take all course with 0 pre and add to the queue
- traverse all course in the queue, and delete one one prerequist for other courses
- when there is still course left in the queue but no 
- use a degree array and a map for storing the graph
- class A: degree = 0 | {A, [B, C, D, E]}
- when pop A, all BCDE's degree need to be reduced.

import numpy as np
