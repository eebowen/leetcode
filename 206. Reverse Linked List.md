## 206. Reverse Linked List (Easy)
\[tag\] two pointers, recursion
### Method 1. Two pointers and iteratively
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # use two pointers: prev and cur
        prev, cur = None, head
        while cur:
            cur_next = cur.next
            cur.next = prev
            prev = cur
            cur = cur_next
        return prev
```

### Method 2. Recursion
- fixed the first pointer and recursive reverse the latter ones
```python
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # this is only for storing the new head.
        new_head = head
        if not head:
            return None
        if head.next:
            new_head = self.reverseList(head.next)
            head.next.next = head
        head.next = None
        return new_head
```
