## 505. The Maze II (Medium)
### Algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm

- use a function to calculate sortest distance to all node, and store in an matrix.
- using a priority queue: [x, y, distance], PQ is sorted by distance. 
- while:
    - pop PQ. in the PQ, there will all different ways to go stored and we choose the closest path to go first.
    - don't check if meet the target since there might be a closer road.
    - each node go to 4 directions set count to 0 for each direction.
    - in each direction, use while loop to go forward until hit wall, and count the steps.
    - dont forget to -1 for x and ywhen on the wall
    - calculate the new distance. 
    - if new distance < distanceArray[x][y], update distance array and push it to the PQ. dont care about a larger distance.
    
- in main function
    - initialize the distance array to maxint
    - if distance of distination if still maxint, return -1, otherwise return distance.
