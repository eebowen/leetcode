## 542. 01 Matrix (Medium)
[tag] shortest path, BFS
- Has multiple targets, use all of them as starting point to be more efficient. 

```python
'''
add all 0 to queue and change all 1 to -1
for each element:
    add 0 to queue
    change 1 to -1 when appending. 
    change -1 to min distance after visted/pop
distance = 0
while queue:
    for _ in range()
        x y= pop
        newx newy in 4 dirs
            if valid and -1 append so it wont be covered again
                change xy to distance also means visited
    distance ++
