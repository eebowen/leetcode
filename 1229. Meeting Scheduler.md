1. sort both list using begining time. 
2. check start overlap and end overlap. if greater than duation return.
3. else who ends first, index ++

```python
class Solution:
    def minAvailableDuration(self, slots1: List[List[int]], slots2: List[List[int]], duration: int) -> List[int]:
        slots1.sort()
        slots2.sort()
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(slots1) and j < len(slots2):
            # determine start overlapping time 
            startOverlap = max(slots1[i][0], slots2[j][0])
            endOverlap = min(slots1[i][1], slots2[j][1])
            if (endOverlap - startOverlap) >= duration:
                return [startOverlap, startOverlap + duration]
            # the eailier ended slot ++
            elif slots1[i][1] > slots2[j][1]:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        return []
```
