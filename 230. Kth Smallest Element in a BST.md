### 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
## Algorughm 1. Using Stack and Inorder Traversal
- Using inorder stack method and a counter for the smallest k element
- Time complexity: O(H+k), where H is a tree height. This complexity is defined by the stack, which contains at least H+k elements, since before starting to pop out one has to go down to a leaf. This results in O(logN+k) for the balanced tree and O(N+k) for completely unbalanced tree with all the nodes in the left subtree.
- Space complexity: O(H) to keep the stack, where H is a tree height. That makes O(N) in the worst case of the skewed tree, and O(logN) in the average case of the balanced tree.

Python
```python
class Solution(object):
    def kthSmallest(self, root, k):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if k == 0:
            return None
        tracker = 0
        treeStack = []
        cur = root
        
        while(cur or treeStack):
            while cur:
                treeStack.append(cur)
                cur = cur.left
            cur = treeStack.pop()
            tracker += 1
            if tracker == k:
                return cur.val
            cur = cur.right
            # or use 
            '''
            k -= 1
            if not k:
                return root.val
            '''
```
