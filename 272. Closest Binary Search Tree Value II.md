## 272. Closest Binary Search Tree Value II
1. problem: if target = 3, return [0 1 2] or return [4, 5, 6]


### Algorithm 1. Transfer to list and sort
1. inorder traverse the tree and flat it to an array.
2. sort it by the distance to the target.
3. return first k closest elements.
Time: O(N) + O(NlogN)
Spack: O(N)
```python
class Solution:
    def closestKValues(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: float, k: int) -> List[int]:
        #O(N)
        def inorder(r):
            return inorder(r.left) + [r.val] + inorder(r.right) if r else []
        # O(NlogN)
        nums = inorder(root)
        # sort with distance to target
        nums.sort(key = lambda x: abs(x-target))
        return nums[:k]     
```

### Algorithm 2. 
1. Using Heap to store the top K nearest, when exceed, pop out the farthest one (on the top of the heap).
2. Convert heap to list.
- if target is 3, first method will return 0 1 2, the second will return 4 5 6.

- Before optimization: 
  - Time: O(Nlogk) to push N elements into the heap of the size kk.
  - Space: O(K+H) to keep the heap of k elements and the recursion stack of the tree height.
- After optimization:
  - Time: The overall worst-case time complexity would be still O(Nlogk), but the average time could be improved to O(Hlogk), where H is a tree height.
  - Space: 
```python
# using a min heap ranked using less close element to the target
# so when pop, the max target will be poped first.
# while traversing, add/remove things to the heap.
from heapq import heappush, heappop
class Solution:
    def closestKValues(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: float, k: int) -> List[int]:
        
        def inorder(oneNode):
            if not oneNode:
                return
            inorder(oneNode.left)
            # insert a tuple to heap (distance, node value)
            heappush(treeHeap, (-abs(oneNode.val - target), oneNode.val))
            if len(treeHeap) > k:
                heappop(treeHeap)
            inorder(oneNode.right)
            
        treeHeap = []
        inorder(root)
        return [x for _, x in treeHeap]
```

Optimized python code with a if statement to stop pushing to heap.
Inorder traversal pops the elements in the sorted order. Hence once the distance of the current element to the target becomes greater than the distance of the first element in a heap, one could stop the computations

``` python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
class Solution:
    def closestKValues(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: float, k: int) -> List[int]:
        
        def inorder(oneNode):
            if not oneNode:
                return
            # when heap is full and the distance is larger than max in heap.
            if (len(treeHeap) >= k) and (abs(oneNode.val - target) > abs(treeHeap[0][0] - target)):
                return
            inorder(oneNode.left)
            
            # insert a tuple to heap (distance, node value)
            heappush(treeHeap, (-abs(oneNode.val - target), oneNode.val))
            if len(treeHeap) > k:
                heappop(treeHeap)
            inorder(oneNode.right)
            
        treeHeap = []
        inorder(root)
        return [x for _, x in treeHeap]
```
