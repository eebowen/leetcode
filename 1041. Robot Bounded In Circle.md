## 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle (Medium)
[tag] tricky, directions, math, simulation

- Tricky question
- Two conditions:
  1. return to origin after one iter.
  2. location changed and direction also changed at the end of one iter.
- L: 0,1 -> -1 0 -> 0 -1
- R: 0 1 -> 1 0 -> 0 -1


```python


class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        loc = [0, 0]
        direction = [0, 1] # north x,y
        for instruction in instructions:
            if instruction == 'G':
                loc[0] = loc[0] + direction[0]
                loc[1] = loc[1] + direction[1] 
            elif instruction == 'L':
                direction[0] = -direction[1]
                direction[1] = direction[0]
            else:
                direction[0] = direction[1]
                direction[1] = - direction[0]
        if loc == [0, 0] or direction != [0,1]:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
