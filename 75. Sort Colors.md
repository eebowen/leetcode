## 75. Sort Colors (Mdeium)
\[tag\] two pointers
- use 3 pionters: two fixed pointers, l and r, on both side for representing 0 and 2.
- one pointer m as a floating pointer in the middle.
- while m <= r keep going, otherwise, done. 

```python
'''
- two fixed pointer on both side for 0 and 2
- one floating pointer representing numbers to be modified.

0 0 1 1 2 2
    l        
      r
      m

if m swap with l, l and m += 1.
if m swap with r, r -= 1, m saty the same.
